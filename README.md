# GroceryApp
Goal is to create an app that does price comparsions for specified items between multiple grocery stores/merchants and if possible notify when specified items go on sale between merchants.

I plan on using Python to pull this data using a few libraries as well as an api if possible. 

First step is to get a rough draft of how I would like to pull the data/compare it among merchants and exactly what merchants to pull from. 

Secondly, establish a wireframe of the application of features wanted and how they will need to be implemented. This will include a rough draft on necessary HTML/CSS3 

There is a ton more to add to this but tackling it one step at a time and will update each step of the way as I find out more :)
